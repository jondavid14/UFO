## Overview of Analysis
The goal of this analysis is to create a webpage with a dynamic table that shows the filtered results of the UFO sightings data. The original webpage that was created only provided users with a date filter. However, for this project, we want to allow users to filter the data with more than just the date. Additional filters for the table will include city, state, country, and shape.

## Results
the new version will be able to filter, it is hard at time visually to sort and filter in your own head. with this you can filter with a text box to narrow down the results

## Summary of Analysis
One drawback is that lack of scaling. you would not be able touse this on a phone or a tablet. but with a few moidifacrtions you can set the screen size to adjust if its under or over a certain amount.
